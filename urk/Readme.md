# Remote behavior

## Add remote on main

- create remote-1 on main -> mountBranchName: autogenerated-1, remoteBranchName: autogenerated-1, portalMainBranch: main - dont reset

- create remote-2 on autogenerated-1 -> mountBranchName: autogenerated-1, remoteBranchName: autogenerated-1, portalMainBranch: main - dont reset

NOT MERGED YET, got update (autoMerge doesn't work yet)

should we sync branch before updates?

- upload remote-1 changes into autogenerated-1

- upload remote-2 changes into autogenerated-2

merge autogenerated-1 into main (all subsequent changes will be automerged)

- update remote-1 -> mountBranchName: main, remoteBranchName: autogenerated-1, portalMainBranch: main - reset autogenerated-1

- update remote-2 -> mountBranchName: main, remoteBranchName: autogenerated-2 portalMainBranch: main - reset autogenerated-2

## Add remote on non-main

- create remote-1 on non-main -> mountBranchName: non-main, remoteBranchName: non-main, portalMainBranch: main - dont reset

- create remote-2 on non-main -> mountBranchName: non-main, remoteBranchName: non-main, portalMainBranch: main - dont reset

NOT MERGED YET, got update (autoMerge doesn't work yet)

- upload remote-1 changes into non-main

- upload remote-2 changes into non-main

merge non-main into main (all subsequent changes will be automerged)

- update remote-1 -> mountBranchName: main, remoteBranchName: autogenerated-1, portalMainBranch: main - reset autogenerated-1

- update remote-2 -> mountBranchName: main, remoteBranchName: autogenerated-2 portalMainBranch: main - reset autogenerated-2
